  Compositor-agnostic desktop automation CLI tools — Wayland-native input (wtype), X11, and clipboard (wl-clipboard) — that back the `wl:` check verb on wlroots compositors (sway, labwc) and partially on KWin.
  Use when working with the `wl:` check verb, Wayland desktop automation, keyboard/window control, or clipboard tooling.

# wl-tools - Compositor-Agnostic Desktop Automation Tools

## Overview

Provides CLI tools for desktop automation — Wayland-native, X11, and clipboard. Used by the `wl:` check verb (served out-of-process by candy/plugin-wl). Works on all wlroots compositors (sway, labwc). No daemon or special device access needed.

These are **wlroots-only** tools (sway/labwc). On a headless rootless **KWin** (KDE Plasma) pod they do NOT work and each HANGS: KWin implements none of the wlroots protocols they require — `wtype` needs `zwp_virtual_keyboard_manager_v1`, `wl-clipboard` needs `wlr-data-control`, `wlr-randr` needs `wlr-output-management`. So on KWin `plugin-wl` is **compositor-aware** (`detectCompositor`) and drives window management through **`kdotool`** (KWin scripting, shipped by `/charly-selkies:kde-shell`) instead — proven live: `check-selkies-kde-pod`'s `wl-verb-dispatches` probe passes (`wl: status` → `compositor: kwin`), and `plugin-wl` fail-fasts the wlroots paths (a clear "unsupported on KWin" error, never a hang). The bed authors no `wl:` clipboard/input/resolution probes (labwc doesn't lean on them either), but `wl: status` + kdotool window automation are live and asserted. See the "What works where" table below and `/charly-check:wl` "Compositor Compatibility".

**Note:** Screenshots are NOT included in this candy. Use `wl-screenshot-grim` (sway) or `wl-screenshot-pixelflux` (selkies) depending on your compositor.

## Candy Definition

```yaml
rpm:
  packages:
    - wtype
    - wlrctl
    - xdotool
    - xprop
    - xwininfo
    - wl-clipboard
    - wlr-randr
    - ydotool
```

No dependencies — compositor-agnostic. Works with sway, labwc, or any wlroots compositor.

| Packages | `wtype`, `wlrctl`, `xdotool`, `xprop`, `xwininfo`, `wl-clipboard`, `wlr-randr`, `ydotool` |
| Service | None (all tools are one-shot CLI commands) |
| Ports | None |

## Tools

### Wayland Tools

| Tool | Protocol | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| `wtype` | `zwp_virtual_keyboard_v1` | Keyboard input (type text, send keys, key combos with `-M`) |
| `wlrctl` | `wlr-virtual-pointer`, `wlr-foreign-toplevel-management` | Pointer control (move, click) + window management (list, focus, close, fullscreen, minimize) |
| `wl-copy` / `wl-paste` | `wlr-data-control` | Clipboard read/write |
| `wlr-randr` | `wlr-output-management` | Output resolution query and set |
| `ydotool` | `/dev/uinput` | Wayland-native mouse drag, scroll (press/release separation) |

### X11 Tools (via XWayland)

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `xdotool` | X11 window interaction (click, type, key, move, search, activate, scroll) |
| `xprop` | X11 window property inspection (WM_CLASS, _NET_WM_NAME, _NET_WM_PID) |
| `xwininfo` | X11 window geometry information |

All packages are in Fedora official repos.

## Included In

- `sway-desktop` metalayer (+ `wl-screenshot-grim` for screenshots)
- `selkies-desktop` metalayer (+ `wl-screenshot-pixelflux` for screenshots)

## What works where

| Tool | sway | labwc (selkies) | KWin (KDE Plasma) |
|------|------|-----------------|-------------------|
| wtype | YES | YES | NO — HANGS (needs `zwp_virtual_keyboard_manager_v1`, absent on KWin) |
| wlrctl pointer | YES | YES | NO (no host-safe pointer backend; click/mouse/scroll/drag unsupported on KWin) |
| wlrctl toplevel | YES | YES | via **`kdotool`** (plugin-wl routes window mgmt through KWin scripting) |
| wlr-randr | YES | YES | NO — HANGS (needs `wlr-output-management`, absent on KWin) |
| wl-clipboard | YES | YES | NO — HANGS (needs `wlr-data-control`, NOT implemented by KWin) |
| xdotool | YES (XWayland) | YES (XWayland on-demand) | YES (XWayland on-demand) |
| ydotool | YES | YES (needs /dev/uinput) | n/a (KWin pointer is unsupported) |

On a **headless rootless KWin pod the wlroots-backed `wl:` tools do NOT work** — KWin
implements none of the wlroots protocols they require, so `wtype`, `wl-clipboard`, and
`wlr-randr` each HANG until the caller's deadline. `plugin-wl` is therefore
**compositor-aware** (`detectCompositor`): on KWin it routes window management through
**`kdotool`** (KWin scripting) and fail-fasts the wlroots paths with a clear
"unsupported on KWin" error instead of hanging. Proven live on `check-selkies-kde-pod`:
`wl: status` → `compositor: kwin` (the `wl-verb-dispatches` probe passes) alongside the
desktop-ready + frame-not-black stream coverage the labwc flavor also asserts.
