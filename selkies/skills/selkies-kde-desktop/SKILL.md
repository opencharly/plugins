# selkies-kde-desktop — KDE Plasma selkies streaming flavor

`selkies-kde-desktop` is the **KDE Plasma flavor** of the selkies streaming
desktop, the sibling of the labwc flavor (`selkies-desktop`). Both share one
transport core and differ ONLY in the nested compositor (R3 — no duplicated
streaming stack).

## Three-tier decomposition (shared with the labwc flavor)

- **`selkies-core`** — the compositor-agnostic streaming spine: the `selkies`
  transport (pixelflux owns `wayland-1` + capture-server + traefik:3000 +
  ffmpeg + pipewire) plus the shared fixings (chrome, chrome-cdp, desktop-fonts,
  wl-tools, wl-screenshot/record/overlay-pixelflux, a11y-tools, xterm, tmux,
  asciinema, fastfetch, sshd). NO compositor, NO panel/notifier.
- **`kde-selkies`** — the KDE nested-compositor PRIMITIVE (the swappable seam,
  analogous to `labwc`): `require: [selkies, kde-shell, pipewire, dbus]`; a
  single supervisord service (`kde-selkies-session`, priority 12, `scope: user`)
  that polls for `/tmp/wayland-1` then launches `kwin_wayland --wayland-display
  wayland-1` DIRECTLY (nested) + `plasmashell` on kwin's `wayland-0` — see the
  De-SDDM section for why NOT `startplasma-wayland`.
- **`kde-shell`** — the SDDM-free Plasma SESSION package leaf (plasma-desktop
  deps-puller + kwin_wayland + plasmashell + the core session components +
  curated apps), shared by `kde-desktop` (bare-metal SDDM seat) and `kde-selkies`
  (headless pod). Workstation-only extras (kdeconnect, bluedevil, partition
  tools, kwallet, …) stay in `kde-desktop` so the streaming pod stays lean.
- **`selkies-kde-desktop`** (this metalayer) = `selkies-core` + `kde-selkies`
  (which pulls `kde-shell` transitively). KDE ships its own audio applet
  (plasma-pa) + panel + notifier, so there is NO waybar/swaync/pavucontrol here.

## De-SDDM: how Plasma runs headless as a pod (the load-bearing design)

A pod has no DRM seat, no SDDM, no `graphical.target`. `kde-selkies` therefore
launches `kwin_wayland --wayland-display wayland-1` DIRECTLY under a supervisord
poll-for-`wayland-1` service — **NOT `startplasma-wayland`, no display manager, no
`after: graphical-session.target`**. The explicit `--wayland-display wayland-1` flag
is LOAD-BEARING: it makes KWin NEST into pixelflux (present its composited output as
a wayland-1 client surface pixelflux captures) and create `wayland-0` for Plasma's
own clients (plasmashell, Chrome) — the KDE analogue of how labwc auto-nests from
`WAYLAND_DISPLAY` (labwc is wlroots and nests implicitly; KWin needs the flag).

**Why NOT `startplasma-wayland` (the RCA).** In a systemd-less pod `startplasma-wayland`
falls back to the legacy `plasma_session` shim, which brings KWin up on the HEADLESS
backend — KWin holds NO connection to pixelflux's `wayland-1` and opens NO `/dev/dri`,
so it composites into an off-screen buffer nothing captures and the stream is a
uniform BLACK frame (a 4046-byte PNG, luma spread 0). Switching to the direct
`--wayland-display` launch fixed it: real composited content (a 45746-byte frame,
full luma range 16–235). Two supporting requirements: (1) `cap_sys_nice` is stripped
from `kwin_wayland` at build (the `kde-selkies-strip-caps` step) so the launcher can
exec it directly under the pod's no-new-privileges, which rejects exec of a file-cap
binary (`Operation not permitted`); (2) `plasmashell` is launched on `wayland-0` once
kwin creates it. PROVEN on `check-selkies-kde-pod`: full R10 live-check pass
(159 passed / 0 failed), the frame-not-black + agent-check confirming a real
KWin-composited Plasma desktop, verified visually (Chrome maximized + Plasma panel).

**`wl:` verb coverage on KWin — kdotool works, wlroots tooling doesn't.** The `wl`
check verb DISPATCHES on KWin via `kdotool` (KWin's own D-Bus/KWin-script window
automation): `wl: status` reports `compositor: kwin`, proven passing on
`check-selkies-kde-pod`. What does NOT work on KWin is the wlroots-only tooling —
`wtype` needs `zwp_virtual_keyboard_manager_v1`, `wl-copy`/`wl-paste` need
`wlr-data-control`, `wlr-randr` needs `wlr-output-management` (all unimplemented by
KWin, so each HANGS) — so `plugin-wl` is compositor-aware (`detectCompositor`): those
wlroots paths FAIL-FAST on KWin instead of hanging, while the kdotool paths run. The
bed authors no `wl:` clipboard/input/resolution probes (labwc doesn't lean on them
either), but `wl: status` + kdotool window automation are live and asserted.

**Chrome is a supervised `selkies-core` service.** Chrome is launched and
supervised by the `[program:chrome]` supervisord service defined in `selkies-core`
(shared by both flavors — labwc and KDE) — NOT by `kde-selkies-session` and not
by the compositor autostart. The service runs `chrome-wrapper` with
`WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-0`, `restart: always` (relaunches on any exit, including
the clean exit 0 of the nested-compositor startup race), `start_secs: 5` +
`start_retries: 3` (the single >5s startup-race self-exit resets the retry budget
so it never trips FATAL), and `priority: 30`. `autostart` defaults true and is
self-synchronizing — `chrome-wrapper` itself polls for the `wayland-0` client
socket that kwin publishes, so no per-flavor handoff is needed. Chrome works
headless under KDE; `cdp-proxy` proxies its CDP backend.

## Encoder is auto-selected at runtime (one box, every GPU config)

pixelflux picks the H.264 encoder at runtime from the host render node — it uses
**libva directly (NOT gstreamer; no gst-vaapi element is installed)**:

- **AMD / Intel render node** (`DRINODE=/dev/dri/renderD*`, auto-injected) →
  hardware **VAAPI** (Mesa radeonsi; `vainfo` shows `VAProfileH264*:
  VAEntrypointEncSlice`). So the **cachyos base image VAAPI-encodes on an AMD/Intel
  host** — "CPU" and "AMD" are the SAME box, not two.
- **No usable render node** → software **x264**.
- **NVIDIA** → **NVENC**, but only from the `*-nvidia` box whose pixelflux is
  built un-stubbed against the `cuda-arch-builder` (the cachyos GPU base's
  pixelflux stubs NVENC). NVENC is proven INSIDE the GPU-passthrough VM (the
  RTX-class card is vfio-bound, invisible to a host pod), never as a host pod.

## Images + test venues

| Box | Base | Encoder venue |
|---|---|---|
| `selkies-kde` | cachyos | host pod → VAAPI (AMD/Intel) or x264 (`check-selkies-kde-pod`) |
| `selkies-kde-nvidia` | cachyos.nvidia (cuda-arch-builder) | nested pod in the GPU-passthrough VM → NVENC (`check-selkies-kde-nvidia-vm`, `requires_exclusive: [nvidia-gpu]`) |

The labwc sibling (`selkies-labwc` / `selkies-labwc-nvidia`) mirrors this exactly
on the `selkies-desktop` metalayer.
